            <p> "We’re a small but nimble family-run take out and delivery pizza shop in Okotoks, Alberta. After watching his parents run a very successful pizza business in Calgary, Matt Cleveland learned how to make people happy, one topping at a time.
                Opening the doors to Okotoks Pizza in 2004, Matt has managed to evolve the fresh, traditional Greek-style pizza his family perfected back in the mid 80s to a more modern and convenient comfort food for today’s family on the go. Although
                the company has changed hands to Doug, the same great quality and service are still offered at Okotoks pizza."
