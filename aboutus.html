            <p> "We’re a small but nimble family-run take out and delivery pizza shop in Okotoks, Alberta. After watching his parents run a very successful pizza business in Calgary, Matt Cleveland learned how to make people happy, one topping at a time.
                Opening the doors to Okotoks Pizza in 2004, Matt has managed to evolve the fresh, traditional Italian-style pizza his family perfected back in the mid 80s to a more modern and convenient comfort food for today’s family on the go. The same
                great quality and service are still offered at Okotoks pizza that has always been there."
