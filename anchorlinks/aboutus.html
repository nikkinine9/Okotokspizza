      "We’re a small but nimble family-run take out and delivery pizza shop in Okotoks, Alberta. After watching his parents 
      run a very successful pizza business in Calgary, Matt Cleveland learned how to make people
      happy, one topping at a time. Opening the doors to Okotoks Pizza in 2004, Matt has managed to evolve the fresh,
      traditional Greek-style pizza his family perfected back in the mid 80s to a more modern and convenient comfort food for
      today’s family on the go."
